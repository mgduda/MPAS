version 0 - original version of code

version 1 - collection of radiation routines into loop using dynamic
scheduling and collection of loops at end of routine that can be
collected without affecting memory footprint. Roughly 10% reduction in
physics wall time

version 2 - collection of radiation routines into loop using dynamic
scheduling and collapase of all following loops into a single
loop. Higher memory footprint since all temporary arrays will be
allocated at the same time. Make negligible, at best change in run
time (possibley 0.1 to 0.2 seconds out of ~37)
